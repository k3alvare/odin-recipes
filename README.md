This project is to build upon my nearly learnt
HTML knowledge in creating a basic website. 
I will demonstrate using different types of images
such as SVG, PNG, JPEGs, and GIFs and also 
creating links to other websites and pages within my
local folder. I will also use different 
formatting option such as different headers, bolding,
and italicism, and making ordered and unordered lists. 
Finally I will create commit messages after every major
section to demonstrate the use of making different commits
and also showing the progress of the project.
